# Hey, I'm Adrian 👋

**Fullstack Developer** with a frontend focus, currently building enterprise software at [EM Systemer](https://emsystemer.no) in Bergen, Norway.

Before tech, I spent 9 years as a chef, including 2.5 years offshore on Equinor oil platforms. The career change was deliberate — I wanted to build things that scale.

## What I've built

### At work
I'm the co-lead developer on a building automation portal at EM Systemer — used by technicians and customers to monitor and manage around 2,000 buildings (schools, malls, municipal facilities).

Day to day, I build out new features, maintain the design system, and work across the full stack — Angular on the frontend, .NET on the backend. The portal also pulls in real-time sensor data from buildings via WebSocket and third-party APIs like Airthings.

*Most of my commits live on the company GitHub, which is why this profile looks quiet.*

### Side project: [PCByggeren.no](https://pcbyggeren.no)
A PC building platform for the Norwegian/Swedish market — kind of like PCPartPicker, but with a community focus.

Users can put together builds, save them to their profile, and share them with others. The platform tracks component prices over time, so you can see if a build got cheaper or more expensive since last week.

**Stack:** React, .NET, PostgreSQL, Docker

Currently in alpha. **Want to see it? Reach out.**

## Fun stuff

**Companion** — A D&D campaign management tool for players and DMs. Initiative tracking, custom content creation, session planning. Built with React, Supabase, and Node.js.

**Game dev** — Prototyping a multiplayer 3D tower defense game in Unity. Still early, but I enjoy the problem-solving that comes with game logic.

## Currently exploring

Using AI to automate and optimize database workflows. I focus a lot on finding efficiency gains — turning multi-hour tasks into minutes where possible.

## Languages & Tools

**Daily:** TypeScript, Angular, C#/.NET, SQL Server, Azure, Figma  
**Side projects:** React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Docker
